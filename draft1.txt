It seems that someone, somewhere is recording everything we do on a daily basis. Data such as what we buy, our phone's location, what terms we search through Google, are all collected (often, but not always, anonymously.) #...# This paper will briefly touch on big data for scientific applications, but will mainly focus on social implications.
For better or worse, big data is changing the way we perceive the world around us. Big data not only tells us about the world as it currently is, but has the potential to shape human interactions in the future. This is a powerful ability and we must be careful to use it wisely.

Criticism of approach to Big Data
In the age of empiricism, it is tempting to think that given enough data, any problem can be solved.
Big data shows us only the way things are right now, at best http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2205145
lack of hypothesis http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2205145

One of the biggest concerns about big data is privacy. ##Especially since in many cases, people are not aware that data is even being collected and stored.


Even more concerning than data is collected non-anonymously# is data collecting that is supposedly anonymous--but which can be connected to individuals by clever techniques. The term de-anonymization# refers to taking an anonymized dataset and intersecting it with another, non-anonymous data set connect records with individuals.# This is especially concerning in cases in which individuals may not even be aware data is being collected. For instance, it probably does not occur to the average hospital patient that their anonymized records could be made available to researchers. And it is even less obvious that someone could potentially connect names to records with the right tools.

Google tailoring search results to individual users--gives you back more of the same, doesnâ€™t prompt you to challenge current beliefs
