One positive outcome of the singularity done right could be that humans would not need to work at jobs. We have talked in this class about the concerns of machines replacing humans in the workforce. However, we can envision an optimistic future in which there is no need for money. We use money as a way of allocating resources among ourselves. A sophisticated system could simply ensure that there are enough resources for everyone without any sort of earning system in place. Computers could plan overall food distribution so that everyone will get fed. Robots could carry out physical tasks such as farming and delivering food to grocery stores or homes. 

One negative outcome of the singularity done wrong could be that there would be no need for humans. One of the links mentioned the possibility that a computer designed to maximize happiness could reroute human neurons so that we become happiest while sitting around doing nothing. It is quite depressing to imagine a planet filled with humans simply sitting blissfully ignorant, while unfeeling machines grind away at whatever tasks they had been given long ago.

I hope I am not alive for the singularity. While it is fascintating to imagine a world where computers are smarter than humans, it is also disconcerting to realize that humans would no longer have control over such machines. Even without a stereotypical robots-gone-evil type scenario, I am uncomfortable with a program so advanced that no human can understand how it works or how to debug it. Perhaps such progrmas will benefit the human race, perhaps they won't. The uncertainty is unnerving.
