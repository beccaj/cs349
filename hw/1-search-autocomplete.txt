I did all my queries in Google. The first query I did was "where can I buy..." and the auto-complete options were "stamps," "toms," "garcinia cambogia," and "a fatkini." Next, I did "how do i" and the options were "put this gently," "take a screenshot on mac," "love thee," and "get a passport." Last I did "list of top" and the results were "gear episodes," "songs," "universities in the US," and "songs of 2013." For the next part of the assignment, I used Google again. I first did "why do men" and the results were "cheat," "rape," "like long hair," and "pull away." To counter that search, I next did "why do women" and the results were "cheat," "wear thongs," "have abortions," and "like tall men." Last I did "why are white people" and the suggestions were "why are there white people in south africa," "white," "called cracker," and "so mean."
